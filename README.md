# Space Invaders

The classic Space Invaders game written in JavaScript just for fun and learning.

This implemetation has been made using [Matter.js][1] library as the physics and render engine. I did it just for learning how [Matter.js][1] works and what are the main features of this great physics library.

I already use [RequireJS][2] as the standard to create different modules in the development.
